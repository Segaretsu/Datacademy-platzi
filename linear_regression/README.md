# Practical course on Linear regression with python


## Module 1: Welcome to the course
### Class One
The teacher for this course is [Ricardo Celis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-celis-809aa76b/?originalSubdomain=co) in Platzi  
the recommendation for this course is to first take a linear algebra and machine learning course.

## Module 2: Introduction to ML and the Algorithms
### Class Two: linear regression and machine learning

**Supervised ML process**  (img1)
1. Have tagged observations of the data that we are going to use to train our algorithm.
2. Have the following two data sets: 
  - **Training set:** Data to train our model. 
  - **Test set:** Data to validate if our training model is efficient or not.
3. Machine learning model (RL model): Model to train with our data sets, for predict future or previous data in based in given data set (img2).
4. Statistical evaluation of the model.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
  - Retraining if necessary.
