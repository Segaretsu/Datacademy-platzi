## Module 1 welcome to the course
### Class One
The teacher for this course is [Ricardo Celis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-celis-809aa76b/?originalSubdomain=co) in Platzi  
the recommendation for this course is to first take a linear algebra and machine learning course.

## Module 2 Introduction to ML and the Algorithms
### Class Two linear regression and machine learning

**Supervised ML process**  (img1)
1. Have tagged observations of the data that we are going to use to train our algorithm.
2. Have the following two data sets: 
    - **Training set:** Data to train our model. 
    - **Test set:** Data to validate if our training model is efficient or not.
3. Machine learning model (ML model): Model to train with our data sets, for predict future or previous data in based in given data set (img2).
4. Statistical evaluation of the model.
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
    - Retraining if necessary.

**Uses of linear regression:**
- Estimate population growth.
- Climate predictions.
- Marketing predictions.

**Uses of classifications:**
- Client retention.
- Diagnostics.
- Image classification.

**Supervised algorithms summary:**
- **Linear regression**: used in regressions.
- **Logistic regression**: used in classifications.
- **Na√Øve Bayes**: data classifier A or B.
- **K-nearest neighbors**: used in classifications and regressions.
- **Decision tree**: used in classifications and regressions.
- **Random forest**: used in classifications primarily and regressions.
